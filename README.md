# TankTactics
A Swift App for running a game of Tank Tactics

Tank Tactics is a long term multiplayer strategy game played on paper slips. These slips show each player's perspective and and all their attributes. During each turn, the players can submit actions, costing fuel. They get more fuel each day, and this acts as the main currency in Tank Tactics. The app to manage these Status Cards, which are printed for each turn, is written as a MacOS app in Swift. All code is open and availible, however any code written by our team is not to be used commercially by any entity under threat of litigation.
